data types, arithmetic, and selection 

### part i
write a program that estimates how many years, months, weeks, days, and hours have gone by since Jan 1 1970 by calculations with the number of seconds that have passed. the number of months must be less than 12, i.e., take out how many years have gone by first, then how many months are left, then weeks, etc. assume that all years have 365 days, and all months have 30.42 days.

### part ii
ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 20. if they enter a number outside of that range, print an error message, and call the function: exit(-1). use a switch statement to output the
corresponding Roman numeral for the number that they entered.

### part iii
generate a random number, and output it. use if statements to determine if the number is odd or even, and output a message to that effect. similarly, output if the number is divisible by 3, and if it is divisible by 10. use the % operator to achieve this.
